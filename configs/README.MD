## Field Template Variables
The [configs.csv](../master/cameras/paths.csv) file uses [mustache syntax](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) to connote variable values in each field. The current variables recognized include:

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |

## Pull Requests

Ideally, test all submissions prior to submitting Pull Requests by searching the camera manual for the right commands and executing them locally via curl, or application of your preference.

Also keep in mind that disabling/resetting commands should have a different `command_id`,
i.e. `/form/setWlan/?ENABLE=1` would be assigned to `enable_wifi` while `/form/setWlan/?ENABLE=0` would be assined to `disable_wifi`.
